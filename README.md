This simulation contains a detector model of an imaging total energy detector (ITED) consisting of a scatter plane and an absorber plane and a water phantom for interaction studies.
The  scatter plane has dimensions \( 50 \times 50 \times 15 \, \text{mm}^3 \), the absorber plane has dimension \( 50 \times 50 \times 25 \, \text{mm}^3 \). THe absorber plane has 4 cmpton modules each having a dimension as refferd.
The water phantom is about \( 10 \times 10 \times 20 \, \text{mm}^3 \)
